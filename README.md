This is my Oblique Strategies app. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

I wanted to play around with Vercel and always wanted my own "Oblique Strategies" application.

It's a great platform for hosting small apps, so I started with one that grabs a photo I've taken and renders a quote from the deck.

I'm not fluent with NextJS, which I know Vercel produces and their platform is designed for, so I made a Flask app that does this.
